# Script for basic color separation using only openCV

This script does color separation in the HSV colorspace, it provides a user interface using trackbars. The trackbars are in a separate window. Large images can be resized for ease of use. The purpose of the UI is to easily find the value ranges to do good color separation in a script of your own.

If your not familiar with hsv: HSV.JPG is an example image taken from wikipedia, that shows the behavior of the hsv colorspace very well.  

How to:
- Open script
- Alter image path (or use the example image)
- Run script
