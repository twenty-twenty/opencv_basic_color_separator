# Script for basic color separation using only openCV

This script does color separation in the HSV colorspace, it provides a user interface using trackbars. The trackbars are in a separate window. Large images can be resized for ease of use. The color separation mask can be inverted. The purpose of the UI is to easily find the value ranges to do good color separation in a script of your own.

If your not familiar with hsv: HSV.JPG is an example image taken from wikipedia, that shows the behavior of the hsv colorspace very well.  

How to:
- Open script
- Alter image path (or use the example image)
- Run script
